### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first few times we started experimenting with nest for loops. Personally I enjoy using loops because they are simple to understand and execute. Furthermore, it taught me how to further understand the way in which for loops and loops in general worked. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was my favorite out of all of the labs because we were reading out a file that contained a certain animation. This one of the first few times reading out file streams from a file and storing it into a value which was interesting to learn about. The code was difficult to figure out in the beginning however when understood how to do it was very rewarding and seeing the animations played were cool as well.

* Lab 10 

    Lab 10, part 3 was a personal favorite of mine because I believe this was when we began coding images starting with the gradient image. This lab interested me very much because it was the start of using RGB colors and using loops to change each pixel in the image. I liked learning about this one a lot due to the reward I felt after figuring out the code.
